<p align="left">[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are there.]</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy
I work with!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's
gotta be something wrong with him!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: <font color="#0000FF">All right Joey, be
nice.&nbsp; </font>So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">(They all stare, bemused.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl- oh!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a
date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: Sounds like a date to me.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">[Time Lapse]</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm
standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>All:</strong> Oh, yeah. Had that dream.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a
phone... there.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: Instead of...?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: That's right.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: Never had that dream.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: No.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
<font color="#0000FF">Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. </font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">Monica: And they weren't looking at
you before?!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><font color="#0000FF">Chandler: Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it, </font><font color="#000000">a</font>nd it turns out it's my mother,
which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">[Time Lapse, Ross has entered.]</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: (mortified) Hi.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Are you okay, sweetie?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: I just feel like someone reached down my
throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my
neck...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: Cookie?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: (explaining to the others) Carol moved her
stuff out today. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">Joey: Ohh.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><font color="#000000">Monica:</font><font
color="#0000FF"> </font>(to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">Ross: Thanks.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air
just in front of Ross.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just
leave my aura alone, okay?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">Phoebe: Fine!&nbsp; Be murky!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><font color="#000000">Ross: </font>I'll be fine,
alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: No you don't.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on
that? She didn't know, how should I know?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They
all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">Ross: I told mom and dad last night,
they seemed to take it pretty well.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">Monica: Oh really, so that
hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., &quot;I'll never have
grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.&quot; was what?&nbsp; A wrong number?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">Ross: Sorry.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of
pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">(Ross gestures his consent.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some
hormones!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I
just- I just wanna be married again!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">(Rachel enters in a wet wedding dress and starts to search
the room.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: And I just want a million dollars! (He
extends his hand hopefully.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Rachel?!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to
your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be
here and you are, you are!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Waitress:</strong> Can I get you some coffee?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay,
everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody,
this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: Hi, sure!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: Hi. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">(They go to hug but Ross's umbrella opens.&nbsp; He sits
back down defeated again.&nbsp; A moment of silence follows as Rachel sits and the others
expect her to explain.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting
for four wet bridesmaids?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour
before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was
looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-
(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned
on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it
hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked
familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I
doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where
to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I
knew who lived here in the city.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an
issue... [Scene: Monica's Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV
and are trying to figure out what is going on.]</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big
pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">Chandler: (imitating the characters)
Tuna or egg salad?&nbsp; Decide!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">Ross: (in a deep voice) I'll have
whatever Christine is having.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry
him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">(The scene on TV has changed to show two
women, one is holding her hair.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><font color="#0000FF">Phoebe:&nbsp; If I let go of
my hair, my head will fall off.</font> </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing
those pants. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: I say push her down the stairs. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey:</strong>&nbsp;
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">(She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's
like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a
shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a
shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you
to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: You can see where he'd have trouble.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll
just stay here with Monica. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Well, I guess we've established who's
staying here with Monica...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe
I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">[Time Lapse, Rachel is breating into a paper bag.]</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try
to think of nice calm things...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and
kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something
with mittens... La la la la...<font color="#0000FF">something and noodles with
string.&nbsp; These are a few...</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: I'm all better now.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to
Chandler and Joey.) I helped!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best,
y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.<font color="#0000FF">&nbsp; The whole,
'hat' thing.</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,
you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding
day!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: What, like there's a rule or something?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">(The door buzzer sounds and Chandler gets it.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: Please don't do that again, it's a
horrible sound.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Paul:</strong> (over the intercom) It's, uh,
it's Paul.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: <font color="#0000FF">Oh God, is it
6:30?&nbsp; </font>Buzz him in!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: Who's Paul?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real
date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: He finally asked you out?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Yes!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you
want me to stay?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: (choked voice) That'd be good...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: (horrified) Really?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine
Guy!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">Phoebe: What does that mean? &nbsp;
Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">(There's a knock on the door and it's Paul.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all
lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">All: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul,
was it?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: <font color="#0000FF">Okay, umm-umm, I'll
just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">Ross: A wandering?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><font color="#0000FF">Monica: Change!&nbsp; Okay,
sit down. </font>(Shows Paul in) Two seconds.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That
can't be good.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">(Monica goes to change.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">Joey:&nbsp; Hey, Paul!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">Paul: Yeah?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">Joey: Here's a little tip, she
really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until
it starts to get a little red.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">Monica: (yelling from the bedroom)
Shut up, Joey!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up
to tonight?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for
Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,
God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big
lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are
coming over to help me put together my new furniture.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited
about it. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just
gonna hang out here tonight.&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF">It's been kinda a long day.</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: Okay, sure.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.</font></p>

summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is
like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.&nbsp; La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some
change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!</font></p>

furniture.]</font></p>

supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm
guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.</font></p>

the bookcase.)</font></p>

bookcase here.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF"><strong>Chandler: </strong>I would have to
say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><font color="#000000">Chandler: </font>I have no
idea.</font></p>

gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.</font></p>

all this fun.</font></p>

furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: You guys.</font></p>

should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I
mean, how clean can teeth get?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: My brother's going through that right now,
he's such a mess. How did you get through it?</font></p>

something valuable of hers, say her-</font></p>

the watch.</font></p>

you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love
with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">Chandler: Look, Ross, you gotta
understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.
&nbsp; <strong>You</strong>, however have had the love of a woman for four years. &nbsp;
Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and
that is why we don't do it!&nbsp; I don't think that was my point!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: You know what the scariest part is? What if
there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's
it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: What are you talking about? 'One woman'?
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,
Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!
Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the
best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?
Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!</font></p>

you gonna say?</font></p>

I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually. </font></p>

God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...</font></p>

<p>Rachel: Thank you. </p>

<p>Phoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was
fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got
here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like,
cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found
aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. </p>
