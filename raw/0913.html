<P>[Scene: Chandler and Monica's]</P>
<P>Chandler: Hey!</P>
<P>Ross: Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what 
happened here last night?</P>
<P>Chandler: Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like 
you! Do you believe that who ever<BR>did something over here last night did what 
they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!</P>
<P>Ross: OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?</P>
<P>Chandler: No!</P>
<P>Ross: OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from 
her office out on your balcony.</P>
<P>Chandler: Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica 
we should put lights on our balcony. And she said<BR>"No, no. It's too cold, 
nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they 
will"</P>
<P>Ross: Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel 
kissing some guy on your balcony,<BR>even though there were NO LIGHTS !</P>
<P>Chandler: So are you gonna...talk to her?</P>
<P>Ross: Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's 
fine!</P>
<P>Chandler: You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it 
and spits!</P>
<P>Ross: No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care 
but...at least she could have told me. You know<BR>I...I've been putting my life 
on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing 
guys she<BR>barely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! 
Ah!</P>
<P>Chandler: No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where 
you're moving?</P>
<P>Ross: I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now 
there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.<BR>And then the other 
day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.</P>
<P>Chandler: Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!</P>
<P>Ross: Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who 
totally came on to me during the inter-departmental<BR>Potluck dinner.</P>
<P>Chandler: Why did I get married?!</P>

<P>[Scene: Central Perk]</P>
<P>Joey: Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken 
tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I<BR>should have my eyebrows 
waxed. Is that weird for a guy?</P>
<P>Phoebe: Well it depends.</P>
<P>Joey: On...?</P>
<P>Phoebe: On how far along he's in the sex change process!</P>
<P>Monica: No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do 
something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,<BR>your eyebrows 
are...</P>
<P>Joey: Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!</P>
<P>Phoebe: Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...</P>
<P>Joey: Oh man! I have to get those done too?!</P>
<P>Phoebe: Wow! Talking about high maintenance</P>
<P>Joey: Hey hey! You dye your hair!</P>
<P>Phoebe: I'm a woman!</P>
<P>Joey: Arghhh! Double standards!</P>
<P>Phoebe: Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar 
tonight?</P>
<P>Monica: Only if I don't have to get up and sing.</P>
<P>Phoebe: But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable 
old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out<BR>and everyone 
booed him off the stage. So funny.</P>
<P>Monica: It's just, I'm not good at singing.</P>
<P>Phoebe: Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better 
singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?</P>
<P>Monica: No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!</P>
<P>Phoebe: OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to 
sing.</P>
<P>Monica: So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass 
judgments on others?</P>
<P>Phoebe: While drinking...</P>
<P>Monica: I'm there!</P>
<P>Rachel: Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something 
really stupid.</P>
<P>Phoebe: Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out 
there</P>
<P>Rachel: No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.</P>
<P>Phoebe: Oh my god.</P>
<P>Monica: You kissed him?</P>
<P>Rachel: Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony 
and...</P>
<P>Monica: Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed 
that?</P>
<P>Phoebe: It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping 
paper.</P>
<P>Monica: Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?</P>
<P>Rachel: You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me 
and, oh and he gave me this scarf...</P>
<P>Monica: I thought you hated him?</P>
<P>Rachel: You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and 
it turns out that line...is a scarf!</P>
<P>Monica: So are you thinking of starting up something with this 
guy?</P>
<P>Rachel: I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you 
know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't<BR>know what to do 
and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.</P>
<P>Monica: Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, 
and you definitely should talk to Ross</P>
<P>Rachel: Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...</P>
<P>Phoebe: Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss 
a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Beauty salon]</P>
<P>Salon girl: Hi</P>
<P>Joey: Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.</P>
<P>Salon girl: Name?</P>
<P>Joey: Chandler Bing.</P>
<P>Salon girl: Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia 
will be right with you.</P>
<P>Joey: OK Thanks.<BR>(Joey touches the hot wax). I touched the 
stuff</P>
<P>Sonia: I'll take care of it</P>
<P>Joey: Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?</P>
<P>Sonia: Oh absolutely.</P>
<P>Joey: Oh good...</P>
<P>Sonia: Are you looking to meet somebody?</P>
<P>Joey: All right let's just do this.</P>
<P>Sonia: We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of 
the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit...</P>
<P>Joey: Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My 
face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!<BR>Just a little bit of shock 
that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK<BR>(He tries to avoid the 
tweezers) Dammit! Woman!! How Hoooow!</P>
<P>[Scene: Central Perk]</P>
<P>Chandler: Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on 
going?</P>
<P>Ross: Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand 
but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.</P>
<P>Chandler: Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I 
mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,<BR>two 
illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....</P>
<P>Ross: That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?</P>
<P>Chandler: What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!</P>
<P>Ross: I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to 
me</P>
<P>Chandler: Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just 
an impulsive one-time birthday thing</P>
<P>Ross: No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a 
bar.</P>
<P>Chandler: Did she go out with him?</P>
<P>Ross: No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.</P>
<P>Chandler: Ah! The high road...</P>
<P>Ross: You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey 
check out those two blondes over there!<BR>Hey come with me!</P>
<P>Chandler: Are you trying to get everybody divorced?</P>
<P>Ross: You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the 
two of us, like college, remember? You...you break the<BR>ice with some kind of 
jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some 
interesting conversation, so<BR>they'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, 
sexy one...</P>
<P>Chandler: I thought I had to make the jokes!</P>
<P>Ross: Don't you have to be at work?</P>
<P>Chandler: Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend 
Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. <BR>We only 
need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!</P>
<P>Ross: Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the 
paper...another flood in Europe? Here�s a question: "Would you...<BR>would you 
rather drown or be burnt alive?"</P>
<P>Blonde girl: Sorry...we were just leaving</P>
<P>Chandler: We still got it!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Ross']</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Rachel: Who is it?</P>
<P>Gavin: Gavin! I brought you some soup.</P>
<P>Rachel: Why?</P>
<P>Gavin: I heard you were sick...</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little 
bit! Hello Gavin</P>
<P>Gavin: I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?</P>
<P>Rachel: I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick</P>
<P>Gavin: Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I 
thought you called in sick to avoid me.</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh no no no</P>
<P>Gavin: So I had fun last night</P>
<P>Rachel: So did I</P>
<P>Gavin: Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold 
for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?</P>
<P>Rachel: It's just a cold</P>
<P>Gavin: Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum...</P>
<P>Rachel: What? What's the matter?</P>
<P>Gavin: What's Ross doing to you on that picture?</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be 
funny.</P>
<P>Gavin: Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want 
to get in the middle of anything</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, 
don't worry about Ross really, really.<BR>(She hears the noise of the key in the 
lock) Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!</P>
<P>Gavin: Yeah! But you said not to worry about...</P>
<P>Rachel: I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!</P>
<P>Molly: Hi!</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.</P>
<P>Molly: No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?</P>
<P>Rachel: Right, right, yes!</P>
<P>Molly: Don't panic!</P>
<P>Rachel: What?</P>
<P>Molly: There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my 
purse.</P>
<P>Rachel: No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my 
business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.<BR>Gavin come out from behind 
that curtain!</P>
<P>Gavin: Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand 
there.</P>
<P>Molly: Hello! I just go and get Emma.</P>
<P>Rachel: OK.</P>
<P>Gavin: So hum...Why did I have to hide?</P>
<P>Rachel: I thought it was Ross.</P>
<P>Gavin: So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between 
you two...</P>
<P>Rachel: There isn't. There is totally isn't.</P>
<P>Gavin: You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming 
out of a chute for the first time. I used to be a<BR>rodeo clown.</P>
<P>Rachel: All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were 
here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in<BR>any relationship 
but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus 
there is just so much<BR>history...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry, 
I'm just all over the place.</P>
<P>Gavin: It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a 
piece of advice?</P>
<P>Rachel: Yes</P>
<P>Gavin: I think you should talk to Ross about all this.</P>
<P>Rachel: People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin</P>
<P>Gavin: Don't be. It's just bad timing.</P>
<P>Rachel: So seriously...rodeo clown?</P>
<P>Gavin: One of the best, ma'am, one of the best...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Mike's piano bar]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Phoebe: "No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the 
world...!" Thank you!</P>
<P>(Mike kisses Phoebe)</P>
<P>Mike: Oh she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here. I got to 
get a break and when we come back we've got Kenneth<BR>singing "I touch 
myself"...I'm not here to judge!</P>
<P>Phoebe: Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.</P>
<P>Monica: No I told you I can't.</P>
<P>Phoebe: But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice 
voice.</P>
<P>Monica: What have you heard me sing?</P>
<P>Phoebe: All the time when you're cooking.</P>
<P>Monica: What?</P>
<P>Phoebe: Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in 
my tummy"</P>
<P>Monica: Yeah I do rock that one.</P>
<P>Phoebe: OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up 
there?</P>
<P>Monica: Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I 
would sing...</P>
<P>Mike: Well I've got a book around...</P>
<P>Monica: "Delta Dawn"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Central Perk]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Ross: Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace</P>
<P>Woman: You already hit on me an hour ago</P>
<P>Ross: Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep 
striking out.</P>
<P>Chandler: I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, 
you're asking women how they want to be killed</P>
<P>Ross: This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the 
one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.</P>
<P>Chandler: By drowning or...?!</P>
<P>Michelle: Why would he break up with me?</P>
<P>Her friend: I don't know sweetie.</P>
<P>Michelle: All I ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. 
I mean, am I so unlovable?</P>
<P>Chandler: Well...</P>
<P>Ross: I know! (he stands)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Piano bar]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Mike: All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of 
"I touch myself". Coming up next we've got Monica<BR>singing "Delta 
Dawn".</P>
<P>Monica: Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.</P>
<P>Phoebe: Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that 
spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone<BR>anyway.</P>
<P>Monica: Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn"<BR>"Delta 
Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone 
by? ..."</P>
<P>Phoebe: Can you totally see through her shirt ?</P>
<P>Mike: Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.</P>
<P>Monica: "To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Joey: Hey, I need your help.</P>
<P>Chandler: Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley 
Judd?</P>
<P>Joey: Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my 
eyebrows shaped</P>
<P>Chandler: I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!</P>
<P>Joey: You may be a sissy but I'll still (pound you out on ground). All 
right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one<BR>eyebrow and now... they 
don�t match!</P>
<P>Chandler: It�s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!</P>
<P>Joey: All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic 
marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so<BR>I don�t look stupid for my 
pictures.</P>
<P>Chandler: Ok. First of all, this is green!</P>
<P>Joey: What the hell am I supposed to do!</P>
<P>Chandler: All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you 
will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.</P>
<P>Joey: What, what.</P>
<P>Chandler: Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the 
lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mine<BR>by plucking the eyebrows 
of my father and his �business� partners.</P>
<P>Joey: Oh my God!</P>
<P>Chandler: Yeah, well, I guess you don�t need my help Victor 
Victoria!</P>
<P>Joey: Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, 
but Chandler I don�t know if I can take anymore<BR>plucking. It hurts so 
bad!</P>
<P>Chandler: Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my 
gentle self-loathing touch.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Piano Bar]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monica: "Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is 
over. Did you see me out there?</P>
<P>Phoebe: Every little bit of you!</P>
<P>Monica: I can�t believe I did this. I can�t believe I'm singing for the 
people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that<BR>one shouting �look at those 
tips�! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?</P>
<P>Mike: Sure.</P>
<P>Phoebe: Mon', not that you didn�t sound good, but...</P>
<P>Monica: Good? Didn�t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for 
making me do this. That�s is the best gift ever.</P>
<P>Mike: Also a good gift? Underwear.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Ross']</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Michelle: Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms 
freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone do<BR>anything else.</P>
<P>Ross: But, what�s great is that you don�t mind talking about it.</P>
<P>Michelle: It�s so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with 
me, because it�s like you lose a boyfriend,<BR>you get a boyfriend.</P>
<P>Ross: Uh-ah!</P>
<P>Michelle: No don�t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally 
over Eric.</P>
<P>Ross: (pfew). Good choice Ross.</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I�ve been looking for you 
everywhere!</P>
<P>Ross: Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.</P>
<P>Rachel: Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o� clock. 
So I was hoping you and I could have a<BR>chance to kind of talk� somebody 
here?</P>
<P>Ross: Oh, yeah, yeah that�s Michelle.</P>
<P>Rachel: Who?</P>
<P>Ross: Oh, just this woman I�ve been seeing.</P>
<P>Rachel: You�ve being seeing someone?</P>
<P>Ross: Yeah, didn�t I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven�t being going 
out for too long, but rather there is this<BR>amazing connection between us. I-I 
mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. I thought it 
was<BR>a little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.</P>
<P>Michelle: What are you taking amoxicillin for?</P>
<P>Ross: How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look 
through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that�s<BR>my roommate, Rachel.</P>
<P>Rachel: Hi, and I am also Emma�s mother.</P>
<P>Michelle: Ah, who is Emma?</P>
<P>Ross: I told you about my daughter.</P>
<P>Michelle: This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Chandler: And done!</P>
<P>Joey: Oh my God! I didn�t feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a 
job because you can tweeze circles around<BR>that sadistic bitch at the 
saloon</P>
<P>Chandler: Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?</P>
<P>Joey: Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look 
great! How you doing!</P>
<P>Chandler: Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little 
worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about<BR>there, but it turned out to 
be a little piece of chocolate.</P>
<P>Joey: Thank you so much.</P>
<P>Chandler: No problem.</P>
<P>Joey: Listen that�s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some 
manly make up for it.</P>
<P>Chandler: Yeah.</P>
<P>Joey: Comb my eyelashes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Piano Bar]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monica: Ok, for my next song I think I�ll sing something a little more 
upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer<BR>Sisters �I am so excited�. And 
make it bouncy!</P>
<P>Phoebe: Oh you�ll probably take care of that on your hands.</P>
<P>Chandler: I am sorry I am late. You�ll understand when you�ll see 
Joey.</P>
<P>Monica: Honey, you�re just in time, I�m about to sing another 
song!</P>
<P>Chandler: Really? In front of all this people?</P>
<P>Monica: And they love me!</P>
<P>Chandler: Oh my God!</P>
<P>Phoebe: Yes, she gives the people what they want.</P>
<P>Monica: All right, watch!</P>
<P>Monica: "Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll 
put all other things aside. Give in this<BR>time and show me some 
affection..."</P>
<P>Chandler: Are those my wife�s nipples?</P>
<P>Phoebe: Oh? Isn�t that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have 
let her go up again.</P>
<P>Chandler: I gotta stop this.</P>
<P>Monica: Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."</P>
<P>Chandler: You, touching yourself, out!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Ross�]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Rachel: Wow. She does that a lot!</P>
<P>Michelle: Ross, you didn�t tell me you were a doctor!</P>
<P>Rachel: What, what, wait a minute! You haven�t even told her you were a 
doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like<BR>an hour?</P>
<P>Michelle: Actually about an hour and a half.</P>
<P>Ross: I told you it wasn�t long, but there is an amazing connection 
between us.</P>
<P>Michelle: You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!</P>
<P>Ross: Are you kidding?</P>
<P>Michelle: Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?</P>
<P>Ross: We�ll see.</P>
<P>Rachel: Ok, Ross, what�s going on here, are we just bringing strange 
women back to the apartment now?</P>
<P>Ross: I don�t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?</P>
<P>Rachel: How do you know about that?</P>
<P>Ross: Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to 
sleep...</P>
<P>Michelle: Emma.</P>
<P>Ross: When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a 
guy you know, for what? A week?</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh, that�s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to 
get back at me?</P>
<P>Michelle: No, actually, see I had to pee, �cause I can�t use public 
bathrooms because the doodie parasites.</P>
<P>Ross: Ok, Michelle, it�s time to go.</P>
<P>Michelle: Well, call me!</P>
<P>Ross: Ok.</P>
<P>Michelle: No, wait, you don�t have my phone number!</P>
<P>Ross: You know, if it�s meant to be, I�ll guess it. Bye, bye.</P>
<P>Rachel: Score.</P>
<P>Ross: Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we 
could come to one of your kissing parties on<BR>the balcony.</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh God, I can�t believe you�re making such a big deal about this. 
It was one kiss, one guy, one time!</P>
<P>Ross: Oh, really!</P>
<P>Rachel: Yeah.</P>
<P>Ross: Oh, really!</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh yeah.</P>
<P>Ross: What about the guy from the bar?</P>
<P>Rachel: What? Who?</P>
<P>Ross: The guy you gave your number to.</P>
<P>Rachel: Whoa, how do you know about that?</P>
<P>Ross: Because he called here looking for you. So don�t tell me 
this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,<BR>ok? You�ve been 
out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didn�t even 
have the courtesy to tell me.</P>
<P>Rachel: Why didn�t I get that message?</P>
<P>Ross: What?</P>
<P>Rachel: From the guy in the bar, why didn�t I get that message?</P>
<P>Ross: Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you 
not look there?</P>
<P>Rachel: Ross?</P>
<P>Ross: I never gave it to you.</P>
<P>Rachel: Why?</P>
<P>Ross: I don�t know.</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to 
decide what messages I should or should not get?</P>
<P>Ross: Who am I?</P>
<P>Rachel: Yes.</P>
<P>Ross: I am the guy who�s taking care of our baby while you�re out at bars 
meeting guys!</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in 
here hoping to have a mature conversation with you<BR>About us! But I can�t do 
that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my 
apartment!</P>
<P>Ross: None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That�s not the 
point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one<BR>Who moved on and didn�t tell 
anyone!</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What�s wrong with us? You 
know when people hear about our situation they<BR>Always ask, �what, you live 
together but you�re not a couple? And you have a baby, isn�t that weird?� And I 
say �No.<BR>You know what, it�s not, because it works for us!� But you know this 
doesn�t work. In fact this is the opposite of working!</P>
<P>Ross: Uh, clearly.</P>
<P>Rachel: And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as 
long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,<BR>Just doesn�t make sense 
anymore.</P>
<P>Ross: Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?</P>

<P>Joey: Hey!</P>
<P>Rachel: Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?</P>
<P>Joey: Ha, oh, of course.</P>
<P>Rachel: Thank you.</P>
<P>Joey: Your eyebrows look weird.</P>

<P>Chandler: �Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never 
understood a single word he said, but I helped him<BR>drink his wine.� So you 
just touch yourself for anything?</P>
